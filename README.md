# flipgrid code challenge
 given a mockup, my task is to create a sign up form where a user can register for a service. The form contains user first name, email addrress and password fields.

 - The page should dynamically adapt to screen size.(media queries)

 ## View 1 - Sign Up page ##
this page includes; 

1. a header, 
2. help text, 
3. a form with 3 fields; First Name, Email Address and Password, and 
4. a Submit button.

OnSubmit, the fields are *required* to submit the form.

# View 2 - Confirmation page #
Upon the user filling out all the fields of the form and clicking 'Submit' button, they are brought to this confirmation page.

Confirmation contains information with their first name and email address.

There is a 'Sign In' button on this page (does not require functionality now).
